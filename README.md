# EatABurger

*EatABurger* is the world's finest purveyor of virtual burgers. Take a look at the available burgers: if one looks good, go ahead and click the "DEVOUR" button to move it to the "Devoured Burgers" area. If you don't see the burger you want, go ahead and add it to the menu with the handy form we've provided!

*EatABurger* is a full-stack app powered by Express.js, MySQL, and Handlebars.js. It also features a custom-built ORM to run its SQL queries and follows the MVC design pattern.

SQL files for starting a copy of the database are found in */db/* and the burger model is in */models/burger.js* Public-facing stylesheets and the logo can be found in */assets/*, and the handlebars views and layouts can be found in */views/*
